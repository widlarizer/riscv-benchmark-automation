/**
  @brief         Processing function for the Q15 FIR filter (fast version).
  @param[in]     S          points to an instance of the Q15 FIR filter structure
  @param[in]     pSrc       points to the block of input data
  @param[out]    pDst       points to the block of output data
  @param[in]     blockSize  number of samples to process
  @return        none

  @par           Scaling and Overflow Behavior
                   This fast version uses a 32-bit accumulator with 2.30 format.
                   The accumulator maintains full precision of the intermediate multiplication results but provides only a single guard bit.
                   Thus, if the accumulator result overflows it wraps around and distorts the result.
                   In order to avoid overflows completely the input signal must be scaled down by log2(numTaps) bits.
                   The 2.30 accumulator is then truncated to 2.15 format and saturated to yield the 1.15 result.

  @remark
                   Refer to \ref arm_fir_q15() for a slower implementation of this function which uses 64-bit accumulation to avoid wrap around distortion.  Both the slow and the fast versions use the same instance structure.
                   Use function \ref arm_fir_init_q15() to initialize the filter structure.

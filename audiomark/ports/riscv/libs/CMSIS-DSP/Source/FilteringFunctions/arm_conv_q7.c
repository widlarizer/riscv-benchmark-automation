  @brief         Convolution of Q7 sequences.
  @param[in]     pSrcA      points to the first input sequence
  @param[in]     srcALen    length of the first input sequence
  @param[in]     pSrcB      points to the second input sequence
  @param[in]     srcBLen    length of the second input sequence
  @param[out]    pDst       points to the location where the output result is written.  Length srcALen+srcBLen-1.
  @return        none

  @par           Scaling and Overflow Behavior
                   The function is implemented using a 32-bit internal accumulator.
                   Both the inputs are represented in 1.7 format and multiplications yield a 2.14 result.
                   The 2.14 intermediate results are accumulated in a 32-bit accumulator in 18.14 format.
                   This approach provides 17 guard bits and there is no risk of overflow as long as <code>max(srcALen, srcBLen)<131072</code>.
                   The 18.14 result is then truncated to 18.7 format by discarding the low 7 bits and then saturated to 1.7 format.
  @remark
                   Refer to \ref arm_conv_opt_q7() for a faster implementation of this function.
